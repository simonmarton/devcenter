You are able to authenticate yourself with your Bitbucket user against **Bitrise**. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and of course you won't have to authorize your Bitbucket account when adding repositories hosted by these providers again.

Select `Bitbucket` for authenticating yourself with this service.

## Authorize Bitrise

You have to authorize Bitrise before we can establish the connection. This means you give permissions to Bitrise to access (read) your repositories.

If you press the `Grant access` button, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finish signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service's availability, you are also able to connect more accounts, GitHub **and** Bitbucket, for example. Last, but not least, you don't have to stick to your connected account's username.

After that, you are ready to roll.

From now on, you are able to sign in with a click of a button. Choose your favorite!
